Introducing "Astro Conquest: Clash of Planets"  

Astro Conquest is an exciting and immersive mobile game available for both iOS and Android, combining the captivating gameplay of Poly Star and the strategic elements of Clash of Clans. In this game, you embark on an interstellar adventure as a courageous astronaut stationed on Pluto, which serves as your home base and starting planet. Your ultimate goal is to conquer the galaxy by expanding your reach and dominating the leaderboard.

Upon completing the tutorial and escaping from Pluto, you find yourself amidst a vast expanse of planets waiting to be explored. The game interface presents you with an infinite list of planets, with your own planets displayed at the top while other players' planets are listed below. Tapping on a planet triggers the loading of a planet widget that provides key information such as the planet's icon, name, and status. By clicking on a planet, you gain the ability to inspect it and evaluate its potential.

Within the game, you have the option to challenge other astronauts for their planets, and likewise, other players can challenge you for the ownership of your planets. When a challenge is initiated, you can choose to accept or decline it based on your strategic assessment. Additionally, you have the option to destroy a planet to acquire valuable resources. However, the resources obtained through destruction will be limited to less than 70% of their original value, encouraging players to engage in diplomatic negotiations rather than resorting to destruction.

Astro Conquest features a diverse array of 24 different types of resources, ranging from common ones like dirt, water, stone, and magma, to rarer resources like gold and oxygen. Additionally, there are a few unique resources created specifically for the game, such as exotic diamonds, which can be obtained through in-app purchases. These resources play a crucial role in expanding your empire and advancing your technology.

Each planet in the game boasts its own unique characteristics. Some planets may have rings encircling them, while others might have stunning asteroid belts. Certain planets may feature picturesque clouds, while others are covered in rugged rocky terrain. The icons representing the planets also vary, with some planets adorned in a regal purple hue and others showcasing a multitude of craters. There are even planets entirely composed of vast oceans, presenting distinct challenges and opportunities for resource gathering.

The acquisition of new planets in Astro Conquest is facilitated through cases. These cases can be obtained by grinding through gameplay or purchased with universal gems, a form of in-game currency. Opening cases grants players the chance to discover and claim new planets, adding to their ever-growing galactic empire.

In the thrilling 1v1 style matches, players engage in real-time dual-screen battles for resources. You can send powerful missiles to attack opponents' planets while simultaneously deploying shields to defend your own. The primary objective is to dominate the leaderboard by amassing the largest number of planets under your command. While obtaining 100 planets may be relatively easy, reaching 300 planets becomes a medium challenge, and conquering 1000 planets presents a truly formidable task.

Prepare yourself for an astronomical adventure unlike any other in Astro Conquest: Clash of Planets. Expand your dominion across the galaxy, engage in intense battles, and rise to the top of the leaderboard. Unleash your strategic prowess and conquer the cosmos in this mobile gaming experience that combines the best elements of Poly Star and Clash of Clans. Are you ready to embark on the ultimate astro conquest?
